Emotional roguelike where you have to battle hurtful words.

Man In A Room Talking Nonsense is an emotional rogue like where you have to battle hurtful words.
- enemies shout sentences at you.

"Man can go insane without his personal silence.
There must be a point where it all halts."

That's a nice 'player in a room' game idea that coincides with recent personal occurrences. Perhaps he's a raging lunatic whose words you have to decipher even though they seem extremely chaotic. Can you see a behavioural pattern?

Game featuring a man of rather older than younger age talking nonsense. He's nuts! He is truly bonkers, I tell you.
The Man sometimes blabbers out things that you should remember as they are important. Decipher the madness.
Sentences spouted by the man are a mix of various sentences heard in his life.
Game ends when the man is overloaded and smashes a TV screen roaring at the top of his lungs and glitchiness envelopes the scene.
